### CameraAssembler Messages ###

# CRITICAL

> invalid board name
> invalid comms name
> invalid sensor name
    The software is not able to match a name in the CameraAssembler constructor with an available component

> invalid IP provided
    provided IP could not be parsed as valid (e.g. '192.168.1.999')

> Initialization failed: unable to communicate with board.
    Repeated attempts to communicate with the board have failed

# ERROR

> Invalid register name
> Invalid register/subregister (submitMessages
> invalid lookup
    An invalid resource name has been supplied for register or subregister operations. This may indicate a mispelling or
    a request for a resource that is not valid for the current camera instance (e.g., "MANUAL_SHUTTERS_MODE" for a
    Daedalus camera.)

> unable to read monitor value
> unable to read pot
> unable to read subregister
> unable to retrieve register setting (getSubregister):
    The software was unable to read the contents a valid resource for an unspecified reason

> unable to confirm set subregister
    The software attempted to set a subregister, but was unable to confirm the setting. WARNING: the actual state of the
    subregister is unknown, the set may or may not have been successful

> not a writable subregister
    The software has attempted to write to a read-only subregister

> checkRegSet failure
> plotFrames: unable to plot frame
> saveNumpys: unable to save arrays
> saveTiffs: unable to save images
> saveFrames: unable to save frames
    An unspecified error has caused the named function to fail

> unable to tune pot POTN; monitor shows no change with pot variation
    The monitor associated with the pot is not responsive to changes in the pot setting; either the pot is
    malfunctioning or the monitor is not connected. In either case, tuning is impossible.

> pot POTN does not have a corresponding monitor
    A monitor reading has been requested for a pot that does not have a monitor associated with it

> replacement string too long (setSubregister)
    The software has attempted to make a bit string assignment that does not fit in the specified subregister

# WARNING

> FPGA self-identification is invalid
> FPGA self-identifies as SNLrevC, which is not supported by this software
    The FPGA_NUM register on the board is incorrect or an invalid board has been connected

> interlacing setting requires dropping of lines to maintain consistent frame sizes (deInterlace)
    Extra lines at the bottom of the image are dropped. e.g., for a factor of 3, 1024 lines are interlaced into frames
    of 341 lines each, with 1 line dropped

> powerCheck function has failed; may indicate current or recent power failure
    The power check function shows disparity between software and on-board timers or is unable to contact the board

> pot POTN set to 3V, monitor returns 2.92V
    Pot tuning was unable to reduce the gap between the requested and actual voltages to less than that represented by a
    single LSB on the pot


### Board messages ###

# ERROR

> clearStatus failed
> error in register read
> unable to read 'ADC5_VREF3'
> unable to retrieve temperature information (getTemp), returning "0"
> unable to retrieve timer information (getTimer), returning "0"
    An unspecified error prevented function completion

> inconsistent mode settings on ADC5
    code is unable to parse ADC5_CONFIG_DATA register

> SRAM timeout; proceeding with download attempt
    waitForSRAM has reached timeout without an SRAM_READY signal. Readoff will proceed without the ready signal

> unable to confirm sensor compatibility with FPGA
    The sensor selected in software does not match that indicated by FPGA_NUM register

# WARNING

> 'getPressure' is currently not implemented on the LLNLv1 board
    Function call is ignored and a zero is returned


### Comms messages ###

# CRITICAL

> CountCards failure
> OpenConnection failure, error
> Unable to open serial connection
> ZestETM1Init failure
    An unspecified error has caused the communications system to fail

> no Orange Tree cards found
> No usable board found
> No usable board found at port N
    The software was unable to locate an appropriate FPGA board

# ERROR

> Error detected in readSRAM
> readSerial error
> sendCMD: read payload failed
> sendCMD: readSerial failed (regular packet)
> unable to arm camera
> writeSerial error
    An unspecified error prevented function completion

> readSerial : packet too small
> sendCMD- packet too small, payload may be incomplete
> sendCMD- response too small, returning zeros
> sendCMD: empty response from board
> sendCMD: incorrect response; expected M bytes, received N
    Response packet from FGPA is too small or absent

> sendCMD- regular packet CRC fail
    CRC failed for response of non-payload packet

> sendCMD: payload CRC fail
    CRC failed for complete payload packet

> sendCMD: payload preface CRC fail
    CRC failed for internal (preface) packet inside payload packet


### Sensor messages ###


# ERROR

> Invalid manual shutter timing list
> Invalid sequence setting for side
> Timing sequence is too long to be implemented; timing settings unchanged
    An invalid sequence was used to set timing

> Invalid sensor side: C; timing settings unchanged'
    An operation was attempted for something other than side A or B

> invalid interlacing factor attempted
    A non-integral or impossible interlacing factor was supplied

> sensor not detected
> unable to confirm sensor status
    Sensor-specific signal not correctly detected or processed by the FPGA

> Unable to retrieve timing setting (getTiming)
    unspecified error prevented timing information retrieval


# WARNING

> Due to sequence length, actual timing sequence will be...
    If timing sequence does not fit four times into 40 bits, FPGA rollover of the timing register may result in a
    different actual sequence being generated
